				From the affinity diagram, we see that majority of the students find that it boring to learn, so we infer that it is important to incorporate a fun factor into game that would spur their interest to learn. Whereas for parents and teachers, they are more focused on the learning values that the game has to offer. As such, we decided to allocate greater importance to both the fun factor and learning values when coming up with the game. Other general concerns would be cost and safety. We would not want too expensive a game. Also, we would definitely want a game that would not potentially cause any harm to the players.
			</p>
			<p>
				Learning value would be how well the game can fulfill the goals set out in the affinity diagram. These include ability to make appropriate inferences, engage in active discussion with peers, understanding of the application of chemistry in real life, engaging in hands-on activity, and ability to visualise chemical element.
