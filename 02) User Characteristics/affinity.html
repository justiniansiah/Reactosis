			<h2>Affinity Diagram</h2>
			<div class="container_text">
				We surveyed students, teachers and parents to get an understanding of the difficulties they faced in learning or teaching Chemistry. With that, we made an affinity diagram based on the feedback we received. We categorised the responses according to their Quality Attributes and further categorised these attributes into design goals.
